# TopK-algorithm

TopK algorithm for multi-threaded file reading and sorting. <br /> 
## Project is held by CS3101 Opearting Systems course and has following objectives:
- Learn to work with multi-threaded programming 
- Perform parallel file IO and sorting techniques
- Apply theoretical knowledge on practice 

<br />

## Problem
- Project requires to design fast I/O and searching Top-K algorithm that finds most frequent hours in given multiple files. 
- Input format: timestamp, content. Example: 1645491600, ASKJD
- Timestamp range is fixed between 1645491600 and 1679046032

<br />

## Output

```
Top K frequently accessed hour:
Fri Mar 17 16:00:00 2023		3600
Fri Mar 17 15:00:00 2023		3600
Fri Mar 17 14:00:00 2023		3600
Fri Mar 17 13:00:00 2023		3600
Fri Mar 17 12:00:00 2023		3600
```
